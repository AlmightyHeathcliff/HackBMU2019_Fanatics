## Travel_planner
Travel Planner is an engineering solution for those who want to explore the locations that they have never visited before. Travel Planner generates a comprehensive Tour Map aka itinerary for any locality around the world.
Travel_planner provides assistance to travelers by providing them acquaintance of an place unknown to them. This is important to them as they would always want a complete and comprehensive Roadmap of where they will go and what they are going to do when they reach their dream destination.

TravelPlanner helps travelers by suggesting:
* Sightseeing options
* Eating options
* Shopping Stores (store of any kind and choice closest them)
* Hotels options 
* and so forth.

The project is currently under build and this file will be updated as more functionalities are added.

**Problem Statement : When A Person who generally has no idea about that place visits the place, he has very few options. One of the better known option is hiring a guide or buying a tour package himself. Another choice is manually visit each blogs and gather intelligence on his own.**

Solution - Our WebApp TravelPlanner provides a one stop solution to all those problems that may arise due to lack to itinerary. It recommends you the most common/ in practice as the standard routes. It also recommends you famous spots to visit within the part of the destination to choose from. We are planning to use Google Maps for increased accuracy.
